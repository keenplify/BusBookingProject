                    This integrated online bus reservation system was incorporated through the efforts of students at Quezon City University and in collaboration with the Novaliches Public Terminal. This project aims to create a diverse ticketing system through which passengers can access our services from anywhere using the internet, as well as routes for consumers to where the Nova Stop Terminal dispatches their buses.
